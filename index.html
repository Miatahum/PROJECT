            <h2>I Was Angry.' Taylor Swift on What Powered Her Sexual Assault Testimony</h2>
            <img src="img/taylor12.jpg" alt="">
            <p>I think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. 
                The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn’t be tolerated.
                Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances. When the jury found in my favor, the man who sexually assaulted me was court-ordered to give me a symbolic $1.
                 To this day he has not paid me that dollar, and I think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself.</p>

            <img src="img/taylor13.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Taylor Swift herself did not testify, interest in the hearing was prompted by reaction the debacle involving November sales to her Eras tour (in which Ticketmaster handled 47 of the 52 dates, with SeatGeek ticketing the remaining five). Mike Lee (R-UT), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, noted, “As I was driving up this morning, I couldn’t help but notice.
                 I’d never seen more smiling and happy demonstrators than I saw today.
                 I think Swifties have figured something out. They’re very good at getting their message across.”</p>
